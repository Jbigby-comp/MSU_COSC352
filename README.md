  - Functional programming
  - Language-specific systems

## Week-by-Week Schedule

### Week 1
#### Thursday, January 23, 2025 (First Class)
- **Introduction and AMA**: Instructor Background
- **Course Layout**:
  - 5 Projects
  - Certification-style tests
  - Oral Midterm and Final Exams
  - Extra Credit Options
- **Discussion Topics**:
  - Importance of being a polyglot in programming
  - Implications of LLM/GenAI advancements on programming skills
  - What is Turing Complete? Examples and Theory
  - Basic Language Constructs (branching, loops, variables, I/O, etc.)
  - Distinction between languages, modules, and frameworks
- **Project #1 Assigned**: *Hello World in Python (Docker Container)*  
  Write a Python script and package it in a Docker container. The script should take a name from STDIN from the user and print a hello message in STDOUT. Ensure the ability to execute `docker build` for building and `docker run` to execute the program.
